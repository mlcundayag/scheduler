## Description
In this challenge, we were already given a starter code and a mock up that we need to emulate in order to create a simple work day scheduler. 

I divided the tasks into three steps:
* HTML - For the most part, the HTML was already given. The first thing I did is to make sure that all my links and scripts are connected. I then added my timeblocks and added specific classes for the bootstrap styling. I also added some IDs to make it easier for me to target my functions on the javascript/jquery.

* CSS - All the styling was already given. 

* JS - There are basically three things that I needed to do for Javascript. First, I added the current date using moment.js. Next, I added a function in which the time block will be color coded depending on the hour of the day. Lastly, I added an event listener to save my events on the text area by pulling it from the local storage.
